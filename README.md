## ✨ Features

- Arcade and local PvP game modes.
- Online multiplayer with Host/Join lobby flow.
- Character selection with shared roster and per-character animations.
- Health/timer UI, win modal, rematch, and return-to-menu flow.
- Keyboard, gamepad, and mobile touch controls.
- Responsive canvas with fixed internal resolution (`1024x576`) and CSS scaling.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview

- **ES6 Modules**: The codebase is split into modules, preventing naming conflicts in the global scope and improving maintainability.
- **Sprite Rendering**: `c.save()` and `c.scale()` are used for dynamic character flipping (mirroring) without duplicate directional assets.
- **Gamepad API**: Full controller support with movement, jump, attack, and menu navigation.
- **PeerJS Networking**: Lightweight peer-to-peer session management for online matches.

## 🎮 Controls

### Player 1:

- **Keyboard**: `W` (Jump), `A` / `D` (Move), `Space` (Attack)
- **Gamepad**: D-pad/Left Stick (Move), Button `A` (Jump), Button `X` (Attack)

### Player 2:

- **Keyboard (Local PvP)**: `Up Arrow` (Jump), `Left` / `Right` (Move), `Down Arrow` (Attack)
- **Gamepad**: D-pad/Left Stick (Move), Button `A` (Jump), Button `X` (Attack)

### Multiplayer (Online)

- Both Host and Guest use local controls for their own fighter.
- **Keyboard**: `W` (Jump), `A` / `D` (Move), `Space` (Attack)
- Network sync is handled through PeerJS state exchange.
